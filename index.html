        <div class="item">
            <p>
                The website I have chosen to redesign is the <strong>Beacon Inn</strong> - a hotel in Brookline, MA.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and I love the people that work here; however, I do not think
                their website is easy to use or particulary appealing.

            <h2>Learnability</h2>
            <p>The website is not easy to learn because it is not intuitive. Why is there a "rooms" page and a "reservations" page? Users
            who are looking to quickly make a reservation will not immediately understand why both of those pages are necessary. This functionality
            should be front and center on the home page. It appears as though the rooms page is meant to be a display of the available rooms and the 
            reservations page is designed for users to actually book them, but their functionality overlaps far too much. This website would be 
            much easier to follow if the home page was where users could being booking rooms. The small section for booking on the bottom of the
            home page does not show any information other than a calendar, and there is somehow exposed html code below the form. The about us page
            is also very confusing because there is so much content below the main picture in the original site which seems like it is the about us
            page; but there is another page with even more text. This is confusing.
            </p>
            <h2>Memorability</h2>
            <p>Instead of having the main functionality of a hotel booking app on the front page, the user is forced to navigate between different
            pages to see their options and book a room. This makes every experience more difficult than it needs to be, and they are forced to
            remember how to navigate the whole site as opposed to one simple page.
            </p>
            <h2>Efficiency</h2>
            <p>People use website of hotels to get clear pricing, room overviews, and reservations. The convoluted nature of the navigation bar combined
            with the fact that most of the information on the site is dated and insignificant makes these simple tasks more complicated than they need to be.
            Additionally, without an account system users do not have the very efficient option of remaking previous booking. There is also random segments
            of text in the paragraphs that follow the main picture of the original site. This is confusing and furthers the convolution of the site.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Using <strong>WebAIM WAVE</strong> to analyze the pages on this site, the most common error thrown was related to the <strong>contrast</strong> of the site. I agree with this:
            the maroon background demands attentions and makes the text stand out a lot less than it would on a more neutral site. This points to a change I will implement
            in the redesign: inverting the color scheme. It would make much more sense to have a neutral white background with maroon and gold undertones, as opposed to the other
            way around.
            </p>
            <p>This site also highlighted issues with <strong>reduntant links</strong> - the big Beacon Inn logo links to the home page, as does the "Home" button. This is not necessary and I will
            implement this change as well.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, this tool also highlighted numerous <strong>missing labels</strong> - errors which will make screenreaders far less effective - which will make the site less accessible to
            disabled users.
